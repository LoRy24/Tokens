## Welcome to the wonderful land of the Tokens Documentation!

These documents are a _BIG_ work in progress as an upgrade from the
pre-existing [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/TheCoolestPaul/Tokens/wiki).
I am making this change for two reasons:
1. I need to learn GitHub Pages more for other projects I am a part of.
2. This looks nicer and is much more intuitive than the GitHub wiki.
3. I can now edit the documents _in the same editor_ I make changes to the code with!

Please, bare with me as I embark on trying to make this new documentation site
contain more information. I am learning after-all.

### Changes to the documentation
At the bottom of every page in these documents is a link to make an edit to the very page you are viewing! This is much easier on me! If I explain something poorly or litter a page with typos, YOU, the
community, can correct my every word. Isn't that wonderful.
