## Here is a list of all the default files generated by Tokens.

#### [config.yml](https://github.com/TheCoolestPaul/Tokens/blob/release/src/main/resources/config.yml)
#### [messages.yml](https://github.com/TheCoolestPaul/Tokens/blob/release/src/main/resources/messages.yml)
#### [keys.yml](https://github.com/TheCoolestPaul/Tokens/blob/release/src/main/resources/keys.yml)

With **[facelift-2](https://github.com/TheCoolestPaul/Tokens/pull/78)** comes a new way Tokens
handles its own files. Tokens will now generate the things it needs in each file. 
Example: If there is an update that adds another line to `config.yml` Tokens will automatically
add the line with its default variable. It is this way, so you don't have to manually 
update your config with each update to Tokens.

Of course this doesn't apply to `keys.yml` because that file is entirely up to the
user to fill out.
